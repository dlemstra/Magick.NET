# Cross-platform

## Compiling Magick.NET.Native on Linux and macOS

The binaries for Linux and macOS are build on VSTS (https://dlemstra.visualstudio.com/Magick.NET/_build) with the help of scripts in the `Source/Magick.NET.CrossPlatform`
folder. The `Build.Linux.sh` and `Build.macOS.sh` scripts in that folder create a statically linked library. Cloning the Magick.NET repository and running those scripts
on a Linux or macOS machine can be done to create a custom build of the native library.

## Adding support for other formats

Magick.NET uses a statically linked build of ImageMagick to allow for an extremely portable Linux binary. This means for most use cases, it will "just work" on
standard glibc-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS. Unfortunately, it also means some libraries and formats are left unsupported where an incompatible
license or other issue prevents it.

To create a custom build of the native library Magick.NET the `Build.Linux.sh` or the `Build.macOS.sh` file will need to be tweaked.

## Extra requirements

By default, Magick.NET has support built in for JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and WebP file formats. Lossless compression support includes zlib, lzma, and bzip2. There
are no external dependencies beyond basic system libraries and glibc6/libm, which should be present by default on most Linux distros. 

Distributions based on musl libc such as Alpine will not have a glibc available, and will not work with Magick.NET out of the box. If you receive a DllNotFoundException similar to the below it is likely due to glibc not being available:

```
DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'Magick.Native-Q16-x64.dll' or one of its dependencies. 
In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider setting the LD_DEBUG environment variable: 
Error loading shared library libMagick.Native-Q16-x64.dll: No such file or directory
ImageMagick.Environment+NativeMethods+X64.Environment_Initialize()
ImageMagick.Environment+NativeEnvironment.Initialize()
ImageMagick.Environment.Initialize()
ImageMagick.MagickSettings+NativeMagickSettings..cctor()
```

Compatibility layers for glibc on musl-libc systems exist, but have not been tested successfully with Magick.NET. YMMV.

### .NET Core

Running Magick.NET with .NET Core on Linux requires adding the library as a package reference to the project:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Magick.NET-Q8-x64" Version="7.x.x.x" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

### Mono

Getting Magick.NET working on Mono sometimes requires an extra step. The Magick.NET.Native library is not always automatically copied to the output
directory when the NuGet reference is added to the project. The copy does not happens when the project is build on Windows instead of a Linux machine.
The native library located in the folder `runtimes/linux-x64/native` of the NuGet package should then be copied to the output folder of the project.
And it is possible that you will need to rename the native library and prefix it with `lib` (e.g `libMagick.NET-Q8-x64.Native.dll.so`).
